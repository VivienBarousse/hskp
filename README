hskp: HotSpot Keeper

HotSpot keeper is an Android application that connects you automatically to
an open WiFi HotSpot when it encounters one. You can also provide your 
credentials for HotSpots that require authentication (such as Starbucks),
so that you don't need to manually fill the forms before using the
WiFi connection.
